Last Checkpoint: 2023-09-23

Classifying Income for database Census.
Database that considers several factors such as: profession, location, hours worked, gender, age to determine whether the person's income is above 50k or below 50k.

### 📋 Prerequisites

De que coisas você precisa para instalar o software e como instalá-lo?
* [Anaconda-Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/)
```
* Jupyter notebook - is part of anaconda
```
* [Python-3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## ⚙️ Running the codes:

### First run the notebook:
0 Pre-processing Census base

### Then run the note book:
1_Classifying_income:

### Note:  two environments were used for this project, one environment for preprocessing and another for classification, due to some incompatibilities with keras x SMOTE.

## 🛠️ Frameworks  

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
